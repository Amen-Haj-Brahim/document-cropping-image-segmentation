# document-cropper with fine tuned yolov8seg-nano on a dataset of papers

### The app crops the document from an image using image segmentation, for now we have a mobile app and a streamlit app and make a web app.

# to do next:

- mobile app
- test performance on various phones
- quantize model to int8 and compare to float16
- streamlit
- web app
- retrain on more data
- maybe maintain the project
